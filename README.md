# Tizio's list lib

I made this library because I wanted to make some experience implementing basic data structures like lists.

## What it does
The library contains the basics to work with lists. <br>
Currently, they only work with doubles, but in the future I *may* implement <T>-type lists. <br>

## Some examples of features present in the library
- Functions to **push**, **pop** and **retrieve** data from lists. <br>
- Structs of the **nodes** for the various list types. <br>

## Bug reporting
In case you find any bug or a better way to do something in my library, feel free to open an issue, I will look into it when I have some free time.

## Example project
I will link a small project in the repo that shows some of the features present in the library.

If you want to compile the current example yourself (it's basically empty):
```
g++ -Wall -Werror -Wextra example.cpp tizios-list-lib.cpp -o example
```
